            <h3>Taste of Arran: Middle Eastern promise</h3>
            <p>Taste of Arran is an ‘umbrella’ company that brings together 11 premium food and drink producers on the Isle of Arran and acts as a single point for sales, marketing and distribution. They wanted to break into exporting but needed good local contacts to introduce them to markets – and they found what they needed through GlobalScot.</p>
            
            <p>They were introduced to GlobalScot Guy Crawford, CEO of the Jumeirah group of hotels in Dubai who hosted a Scottish promotion week in his Jumeirah Beach Hotel, giving Scottish companies the opportunity to showcase their produce. Taste of Arran’s cheese range was one of the products on show and the Jumeirah chefs were impressed.</p>
